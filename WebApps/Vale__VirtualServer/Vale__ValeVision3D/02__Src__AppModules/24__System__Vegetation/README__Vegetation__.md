# 24__System__Vegetation

Linework plants for ValeVision 3D: clean CAD shrubs drawn from rules and a seed, at the whitecard's own line weight. ValeVision only, with no TrueVision twin. Plan of record: `ValeVision__PLAN__VegetationSystem__.md` at the app's root. Live state: `ValeVision__WORKING_MEMORY__VegetationSystem__.md`.

Adam, 04-Nov-2026: "Use a similar proxy / rendered asset system as to keep assets lightweight for working with and have the renderer doo the work when it loads a view to draw the randomness, there should be rules for shape etc but then radnomisation to create convincing vegetation effect thats not repetative."

## Where It Stands

**All nine stages are built (v2.85.0), and plants size and scale, and have the walls' brightness (v2.86.0).** One switch per project in Dev Tools > Vegetation. Switched on, Tools & Settings has a Vegetation section: Show Vegetation and Transparency for everyone, client links and phones included, and for an author the Asset Browser, the Linear Placement Tool, the Bush Tool, the Linework panel and Save. Since v2.91.0 staff's placing and editing is one panel on the left, the Vegetation panel, which opens when that section is unfolded and shuts when it is folded: Line Tool, Brush Tool, Assets, In This Project and Change Log as dropdown sections, all folded when it opens and one open at a time (`../22__System__SceneAssets/Na__SceneAssets__Hub__.js`), with Undo, Redo and Save Vegetation under them (v2.94.2); the section itself keeps Show, Transparency and an admin's rows. While a path is drawn, the Line Tool shows the plants the next click adds as proxies (v2.94.2). Plants draw in the live view, stills, thumbnails, video and a sheet's 3D pictures on both engines; on a plan or elevation only when asked, by a viewport's Vegetation tick or a project's Show on Live Drawings. Cloud Sync's Sync Vegetation tab keeps SketchUp proxies and the planting in lockstep. Everything below `Na__Vegetation__.js` loads only on a project with `Vegetation__SceneData__Enabled` true, apart from the Dev section and what it needs, for an author alone.

| `20__System__Tools/Na__Vegetation__LinearTool__.js` | `Na__VegLinear` | Draw and edit paths, Advanced, Bake. Its rows are the panel's Line Tool section (v2.91.0) |
| `20__System__Tools/Na__Vegetation__BushTool__.js` | `Na__VegBushTool` | Paint and erase from a palette. Its rows are the panel's Brush Tool section, and Escape folds it (v2.91.0) |

The library itself is `53__Vegetation__AssetLibrary` at the app's root. Its `VegetationLibrary__StandardPalettes__.json` holds the standard palettes, kept by hand (v2.97.0).

## Rules That Bite

- **Nothing here imports three.js in `01__Core__Engine`,** so it can run in a worker, and in Node for checks.
- **Nothing outside this folder imports anything but `Na__Vegetation__.js`.** Two exceptions: the prototype, `85__EarlyStage__VegetationLinework`, the test bench that never ships, and `23__System__Entourage`, whose figure tool shares the tool host, overlay and pick, and whose panels share the stylesheet, because only one tool may have the clicks. They are lazily loaded on both sides.
- **A generator is never edited** once a project can hold its plants: a saved seed must draw the same bush for ever. `BallCluster` version 1 is `Na__VegBuild__Bush`. A new look is a new version beside it, listed in the config.
- **The order of random draws is part of that promise.** Adding, removing or reordering one `rng` call in a generator changes every plant it has ever made, without any error.
- **A change to what `Contour` draws changes the look of every project.** It is not versioned plant by plant, so such a change is Adam's call.
- **Scale is not size.** `Plop__Scale` is the whole plant, on top of `Plop__SizeMm`, with no draw changed. What a plant really measures is the two together: `Na__VegData__PlopSizeMm`, or `Na__VegRun__SizeOf`. Never read `SizeMm` alone as what is on the ground.
- **The fill's colour is set for each render,** from the scene's lights, in `toneFillForCamera`. A material change to the walls' sums needs the same change there. `FillTone` is the sheet's.
- **A flat shell behaves differently.** Every ball's outline lies under its neighbours, so inner arcs never show: a clipped form has marks. Gaps between its discs let lines through: a box has a core. A step beyond an outline must land on some ball, or it draws as a hole: hence the body behind the shell.
- **A clipped run's ends are behind and ahead along its path,** so it is never flipped, and `Plop__Ends` is in its key.
- **Fit moves centres, never radii,** so a stretched proxy never stretches a scallop. It also means a narrow bed can bury clumps inside a mass, which is why a mass never hides what grows on it (`Na__VegContour__IsHidden`).
- **Saved values are integer mm, Y up.** The builder converts to metres once, on the way in.
- **The scene layer imports nothing of the app's.** It takes a small host object from `Na__Vegetation__Runtime__.js`, so the test bench can draw through it. Without a host every draw is a full one.
- **A fat line is never hidden with `.visible`:** empty its count, or hide the root group.
- **Alpha 0 on the fill is only ever written while MaxEngine's AO runs,** and the AO blur sets it back to 1. It must never reach the page or a still. From the see-through share up the fill is in neither of AO's passes, so it stops: the mark then only cut the wall's own shadow out behind the plant.
- **`Na__VegPath` has a twin.** Cloud Sync's `Na__ValeVisionCloudSync__VegetationSync__.py` ports it, draw for draw, so SketchUp shows a path's plants where the app draws them. Checked against each other by numbers (its DEVLOG, 0.6.0).
- **The object is written whole,** so `Na__VegData__Save` first asks whether the server still holds what this window read, and refuses if not: a SketchUp sync or another window may have changed it.
- **A sheet's plants are a layer of their own,** a twin of the depth fog, never in its base picture. Only a viewport's Vegetation tick brings them in, so no existing sheet moves.

## Checks

```bash

```

```bash
python 53__Vegetation__AssetLibrary/Na__Vegetation__BuildUtil__Library__.py index --check
```

The prototype draws through these modules with the real PureEngine: see its README for how to run it.
